# DSA

A total of 60-70% of the interview process is solely driven and headed by DSA. So, you’ll be required to solve a lot of standard questions and questions asked by various tech companies.

If you have sufficient time, do try to spend at least four to five months on Competitive Programming before moving on with DSA.
